# Task_1-of-network-sniffer-
This project is a basic network sniffer built in Python for my CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship. It captures live packets and displays details like source/destination IPs, protocols, and payloads. The goal is to learn how data flows through a network and gain hands-on practice with packet analysis using Scapy.
